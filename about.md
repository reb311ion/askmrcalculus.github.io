Who am I? My name is Magdy Moustafa. Nearly everything that is cybersecurity-related has 
my interest, especially for malware and malware analysis. Currently, 
I work for Fixed Solutions as a cybersecurity R&D Engineer. Besides doing research, I like 
to write blog posts to inform others about the best practices and newest trends in the security world.
My blog posts mostly focus on the methods to analyze binaries with the use of free and open-source software, 
together with step-by-step explanations of both the technical side and the thought process of the analyst.
